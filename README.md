# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**Name**: Sybil Raphael  
**Class**: 1411-001  
**Due Date**: November 15, 2023  
**Status**: Run as expected  

## Description

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. It's designed to help practice Python concepts such as:

- Nested lists
- Nested loops
- Functions
- `f`-strings
- Input validation and conditionals

Players take turns placing their markers (`x` or `o`) on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a win across rows, columns, or diagonals and announces the winner, or a draw if the grid fills up with no winner. After each game, players are given the option to start a new round.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the script.
3. Run the script in your terminal:

```bash
python RaphaelLab12.py
